Hi there!

This is my first venture into using git and GitHub through Code Louisville. It's really exciting, but I'm sure that I have MUCH to learn. If you have suggestions or things I should consider, please let me know!

Thanks for visiting!

I am creating new changes each time I use git and github so that I can practice.

Here we go again...except now it's 2:30am
